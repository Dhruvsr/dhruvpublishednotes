# Vote of Thanks (Dhruv Ramu)

Dear fellow Interact members, Rotaract members, and Rotarians, after two, long, difficult years of COVID, we are extremely happy to be back. The past year had its ups and downs.
However, now I find myself looking at my peers and my role models not through a screen on Zoom or Google Meet, but right in front of me. 
I am pleased that we have a few new members joining us this year, and more in the upcoming weeks as we seek to expand and make as much social impact as possible.
The Interact club to me is not just a club, but an opportunity. An opportunity to hone and apply my skills and direct them towards community service, making a difference, small or big, even if I am a teenager.
"The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members."
This is a quote which I think Rotary and its branches live by, and it is something we at Interact Indiranagar seek to inculcate.
I thank you all for supporting us in this ceremony today, and thank you for supporting the club for the past few years and I am grateful for my fellow Interact members who wish to take compassionate actions and make a difference.
Thank you.
