# Looking back on Grade 9 to Move Forward
*12-07-2022*

1. **What was powerful and what caused it to happen?**
	- Learning the skill and representing the concept of dialectics on stage was very powerful for me, and it is something that I will carry forward and never forget, regardless of the genre which I do theatre in. Dialectics shows the audience the thesis and antithesis, comparing the two perspectives on stage until it is synthesized into a call to action and conclusion.
2. **What should I work on and strengthen?**
	  - I should work on my set design and blocking skills. In the first unit, I think I underutilized my ablity and could have worked on the designer role of theatre a lot more.
3. **What opportunities do I need to look out for?**
	- I need to look out for more improvisation opportunities. While I think I successfully executed the roles I performed in the Brechtian unit, I am still not confident in my ability to create improvised and unscripted performances, developing the character on the go.
