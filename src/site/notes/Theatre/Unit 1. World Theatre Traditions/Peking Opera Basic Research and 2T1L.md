# Peking Opera
-   Peking Opera is the most well known form of Chinese opera, combining dance, music, mime, acrobatics, and speech. 
-   It is an old form of theatre originating in Beijing (hence the name Peking) during the mid-Qing dynasty between 1644 and 1912. 
-   By the mid-century, it was recognized worldwide and Peking Opera’s style was seen performed in other nations such as the United States and UK.
-   Peking Opera is made up of four role types: sheng (gentlemen), dan (women), jing (rough men) and chou (clowns). There are typically several of these main varieties and supported by multiple secondary and tertiary characters in the case of a group performance.
-   The stage is typically bare-bones or with minimal setting and background. This is because the performer typically receives the most attention, partly due to the colourful attire and props.![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/74aePId9E8GIauxPSkE9Kn1VKwlIQW7g9AuSTEecOJH6_NNa8_2rllOeiSaHRVsukhmDP_bxt1-cye_1Bgv1w1_foyPaJuBFuXtCtFwkQR2NHm42FB_WC2b-MNsApyN6C2oA9NdrunTltjGvksk)
    
-   The speech, song, and dance are symbolic and meant to convey a message. The beauty of their movements is unique to the art and renowned for their acrobatics and exaggerated movements which tell a story.
-   Conventional Peking Opera performances typically follow a measured pace in tune with the music. 
-   There are also arias which are monologue style vocals from the performer.
-   Original Peking Opera pieces are typically folk stories or Chinese history, but recent creations often feature contemporary life. Between 1960-1980, many revolutionary pieces were created which contained propaganda by Mao Zedong and his wife Jiang Qing.
- Mei Lanfang was one of the most famous dan performers of all time in the 1900s and contributed to its popularity today. He performed in Japan which led to a US tour in 1930, followed by one in the Soviet Union as well. He met with other theatre practitioners during this time including Bertolt Brecht.
