# World Theatre Traditions Thesis vs Antithesis


**Thesis:**
- Traditions can/should be sustained by understanding the unique language and function in the society.
**Antithesis:**
- _Dhruv_: Sustaining traditions may cause existing prejudiced beliefs to limit a progressive society and discourage contemporary ideas.
- _Noyonika_: Traditions need to adapted and adjusted in order for them to cater to modern audiences and creators. Without this, there will be no development in theatre. 
- *Neeti:* In a technologically evolving world, world traditions fail to be inclusive and adaptable of international attitudes, forcing newer generations to enact traditions with outdated values.
