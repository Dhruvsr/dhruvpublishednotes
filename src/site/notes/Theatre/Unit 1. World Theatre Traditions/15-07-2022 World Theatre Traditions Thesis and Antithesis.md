# World Theatre Traditions Thesis vs Antithesis


**Thesis:**
- Traditions can/should be sustained by understanding the unique language and function in the society.
**Antithesis:**
- _Dhruv_: Sustaining traditions may cause existing prejudiced beliefs to limit a progressive society and discourage contemporary ideas.
- _Noyonika_: Traditions need to adapted and adjusted in order for them to cater to modern audiences and creators. Without this, there will be no development in theatre. 
- *Neeti:* In a technologically evolving world, world traditions fail to be inclusive and adaptable of international attitudes, forcing newer generations to enact traditions with outdated values.


- The wealth of knowledge that has been transferred from decades, centuries even, person to person, requires preservation. Just like fossils and artefacts in a museum for display, we must retain them today. 
- Our traditions are part of our  identity, and go hand in hand with a religion that has directed society in a positive direction for years.
- It is said by Lord Krishna that truth can never be destroyed. It is true; truth can only be obscured.
