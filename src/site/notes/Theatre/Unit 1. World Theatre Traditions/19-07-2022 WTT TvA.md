# Should we study old traditions?
- I have to resemble a religious leader, my partner is Anshika.


- I have been asked today.. to comment upon these antireligious notions. These days people are leaving comments here and there saying that we do not need to preserve these old traditions, that it is limiting us and all that. To this, I say that you have to preserve the wealth of knowledge that has been transferred from decades, centuries even, person to person, requires saving!
- I devote myself to god, as one should, and in the process conduct many rituals and follow traditions.
- If these traditions are not followed, you yourself are being affected. Just like how we save artefacts and fossils in museums, cultural preservation is equally important.
- Our traditions are part of our identity. Our religion has directed society for hundreds of years, and the origins of this book (holding up the Bhagavad-Gîtâ), and the Vedas, the Upanishads, and these sacred texts cannot be hidden away.
-  It is said by Lord Krishna that truth can never be destroyed. It is true; truth can only be obscured by these kind of efforts to go against what we stand for.
