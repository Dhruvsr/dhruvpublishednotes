# Introduction to Logarithms
### Exponential Equation
$$2^{3}=8$$
$2$ is the input, $3$ is the index and $8$ is the output.
- The base always has to be positive because the square root of a negative number is an imaginary number $i$. 
- The domain can be any real number, $x$ is a subset of $R$
- The range can only be positive real numbers. $R^{+}$
- In a log function, the output of an exponential equation equals the input of the log function.
	- The domain and range are reversed as well.
$$\log_{2} 8=3$$
- $2$ is the base, $8$ is the input and $3$ is the output.
- The base always has to be positive, but the output can be a *any* real number.

- $a^{c} = b$ is an exponential statement.
- The equivalent logarthmic statement is $\log{a} b = c$, a is called the base of the logarithm and be is called the argument of the functuion

- $2^{x} = 45, x = \log_2 45$
- $$\log_{b} a = \frac{\log_{10} a}{\log_{10} b}$$
- $$\log_{7} 7\sqrt{ 7 }=x$$

  

## Exploration 1
1. 
   - $10^{x} = 1000, x = 3$
   - $10^{x} = 10000, x = 4$
   - $10^{x} = 100000, x= 5$
   -  $10^{x} = 1000000, x= 6$
