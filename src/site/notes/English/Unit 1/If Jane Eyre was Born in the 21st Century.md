# If Jane Eyre was Born in the 21st Century
- One of the important factors that would affect Jane Eyre if it was set in the 21st century was that the society was very different. The enforcing of various social norms would not be as strong, and the patriarchy, even in rural England would not be the same. 
- If Jane Eyre was born in the 21st century, the isolation would be different. Rather than physical isolation, in a digitized world, she may still feel isolated.
- The teaching methods and general life at Lockwood including the use of violence to institutionalise children would exist either. The conventional idea of an English boarding school for the unfortunates would not be as prominent.
- Is England still a class based society?
- Mr Rochester may be presented in a worse light
- Yet, the elements of Jane Eyre can't go obsolete. These ideas still stand up today, even if slightly marred. 
- Jane Eyre is a Bildungsroman. Without the character development, there would no longer be character development.
