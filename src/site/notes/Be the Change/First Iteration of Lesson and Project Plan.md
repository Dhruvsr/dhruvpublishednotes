# Project Plan
- Dhruv and Akhilesh will be undertaking a project where they will visit government schools lacking in facilities and resources, and teach the students information technology.
- We will also teach them about various payment gateways and platforms so that they can teach their parents to help facilitate the move to a more cashless economy.
- The end outcome will involve semi-autonomous learning where the knowledge we have imparted will help the current batch of students, who can help teach their juniors, and so on.
- We will also use a Raspberry Pi, a low-cost CPU which can help us cheaply deploy computers in the school. We aim to have 1-2 computers in the class depending on its strength. Additionally, we will also be looking out for second-hand laptops and desktop computers which we can use.

# Lesson Plan
- Computer parts basics
- Basics of the Internet
- Opening and basic usage of the computer
- Explaining the importance of technology in the future and why learning it is useful
- Explaining the thought process behind creating programmes, and using Scratch.
- Spending time with the students and helping them learn Scratch.
